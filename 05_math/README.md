Hey, everybody, in this video, I'm going to show you all of the different math that we'll need throughout the rest of the series. I have a lot to cover, and I'll split this video into different sections. We'll cover some basic arithmetic operators. built-in math fuctions. A few functions from the math module. And then a few exercises.

- arithmetic operators
- math functions
- exercises

Be sure to look at the timestemps if you would like to skip ahead to another section.

Let's begin with some really easy stuff, we're going to cover some basic arithmetic operators. Let's say we have a variable[0:28]
